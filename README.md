# **MetisCare Hub**

## **Introduction:**
Hey! I am proud to announce one of the biggest projects I have made to date. With that being said, allow me to introduce MetisCare Hub. This application handles a major problem with modern-day hospitals: Room management. As people rush into rooms for emegencies, day-to-day hospital goers check in with their designated physicians, and more, it becomes extremely difficult for physicians, nurses, and others alike to keep track of which rooms are open for others to utilize.

## **Motivation for the Project:**
Continuing my passion for the healthcare/medicine industry, I went out to research issues hospitals were challenged with today. I discovered that many hospitals, as I mentioned in the Introduction section, suffer from poor room management, where rooms are oftentimes assigned last minute as physicians, nurses, and others alike endeavor to figure out where to house patients in need of aid. 

## **Disclaimers:**
This project does not mirror any existing hospital platforms exactly, which includes their physician names, rooms, etc. Rather, this MetisCare Hub is supposed to show off what hospitals COULD be using or should implement to handle room management during extreme circumstances. I did thorough research into what rooms I could handle in this platform. 

In addition, I made the design decisions that I did so that I could make certain elements simpler in the program. For instance, I kept a set amount of doctors on the doctors page because I figured if more needed to be added, the web designer of the hospital would change the program (In this case, I would do it for MetisCare Hub). 

## **How to Boot Up:**
In the files of the program, there are various requirements.txt files to look into to download necessary packages for MetisCare Hub to properly function on your local machine. 

## **Further Discussion:**
In order to pursue this project, I split it up into various components, including the frontend, backend, database, and Python environment.
