# **MetisCare Hub**

## **Introduction:**
Hey! I am proud to announce one of the biggest projects I have made to date. With that being said, allow me to introduce MetisCare Hub. This application handles a major problem with modern-day hospitals: Room management. As people rush into rooms for emegencies, day-to-day hospital goers check in with their designated physicians, and more, it becomes extremely difficult for physicians, nurses, and others alike to keep track of which rooms are open for others to utilize.

## **Motivation for the Project:**

## **Disclaimers:**
